After almost half a year of using my CV1, I've grown tired of the fact that it's clearly not made for people who wear glasses. 
While I used contact lenses often, they are not suitable for everyday use. After some time, I had to throw away my contact lenses, so now I'm back to my regular glasses and have noticed scratch marks on the rift lenses. To prevent further scratching, I'm considering purchasing spacers from Amazon.
Now my question is if i can use Rift S spacers on my Rift CV1? 
There is a description on the product site that refers to spacers for Quest/Quest 2 and Rift S, but no spacers for CV 1.
Hopefully some one has experience with this or can help me figure it out.
